<p class="p1">
  I am a sophomore at Pomona College studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and (potentially?) Chemistry. I entered undergrad believing that I was destined to be an Environmental Analysis major, but after spending a semester as a lab technician, I soon realized that I liked working with computers, programs, and data rather than to be collecting the data myself. I loved bringing data to life and kickstarting actionable change. The rest is history!
  </p>
<p class="p1">
  My current place of residence is Seattle, but I was born in New Jersey and have lived in both southwest Virginia and Dallas. This past year, I was able to expand my places of residency to Honolulu, Cincinatti, San Diego, and even Salt Lake City, where I worked as a ski-lift operator for the winter (and hit the slopes with Lindsey Vonn!).

  I have worked in non-profits, had a brief stint in accounting, and have dabbled in the service industry. Currently, I work as a Oceanographic Modeling Research Assistant, Data Analyst for my school's Sustainability Office, and Chemistry tutor. When I'm not actively <a href="https://www.sagehens.com/sports/wsoc/2020-21/bios/mandell_hannah_77jm/">playing soccer</a> for my NCAA team, I am on a Reservoir Computing team for my school's AI club, am writing a tutorial in R for environmental scientists, and contribute to the soccer section of a data-driven sports journal. On campus, you can find me debating the 'soup-ness' of cereal, grabbing lunch with the dining hall employees, or slowly accruing guitar skills on the Quad.

<h2>Moderately Fun Facts:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have run two marathons, but have only trained for one.
  <li>I never get to enjoy new music since I'm audibly stuck in the 80's.
  <li>Since the age of 16, I have yet to lose a game of Boggle. Challengers welcome.
