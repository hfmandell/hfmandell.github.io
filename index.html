<h1>Howdy! I'm Hannah.</h1>
  <h2> Recruiter? Click <a href=”https://twitter.com/webcode“>here</a> for my experience.

<p>I am an sophomore at Pomona College studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and (potentially?) Chemistry. 
  I entered undergrad believeing that I was destined to be an Environmental Analysis major, but after spending a semester as a lab technician, I 
  soon realized that I liked working with computers, programs, and data rather than to be collecting the data myself, being able to tell its
  story to bring about actionable change - and the rest is history!
  </p>
  
<p>
  I was born in New Jersey but have lived in southwest Virginia, Dallas, and now Seattle. This past year, I was able to expand my places
  of residency to Honolulu, Cincinatti, San Diego, and even Salt Lake City, where I worked as a ski-lift operator for the winter (and hit the slopes with
  Lindsey Vonn!).
  </p>

<p>
I have worked in non-profits, had a brief stint in accounting, and have dabbled in the service industry. 
  Currently, I work as a Oceanographic Modeling Research Assistant, Data Analyst for my school's Sustainability Office, and Chemistry tutor. 
  In terms of extracurriculars, I am on a Reservoir Computing team for my school's AI club, am writing a tutorial in R for environmental scientists,
  and contribute to the soccer section of a data-driven sports journal. On campus, you'll find me debating the 'soup-ness' of cereal, grabbing lunch 
  with the dining hall employees, and slowly accruing guitar skills on the Quad.

In my free time, I enjoy cute pictures of shiba inus, trying out new restaurants, and sending my friends my favourite TikToks. I also particularly enjoy playing games, whether that be maintaining my 100% win-streak in Monopoly, tending to my farm in Hay Day, or making top-tier pulls as Blitzcrank in League of Legends.


Currently, I am:

 Taking Data 8X
 Rating all LGBT+ content with The Ultimate Queer Content List
Trying to hit 120 pounds for my bench press one-rep max (currently at 95 pounds!)
